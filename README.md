# Foodweb

--Description--

This foodweb project website hosts a food related survey meant to be taken by research participants. 
Food images are pulled from a MySQL database and printed categorically on the screen. Participants drag
the food they would want to eat onto the plate, and continue to answer a few questions about their
eating habits. These responses are then stored in the MySQL database.

This project is implemented in HTML, PHP, and Javascript. It features PHP/MySQL connectivity as well
as drag and drop functionality. The website and responses generate from it will be used for future
research. The fully implemented website can be found at:
